        Why\r\nThe customer promise with the balloon payment loans product is that
        we will get as close as possible to the monthly payment the customer would
        like with the offer we give them. \r\n\r\nOnce a customer gets a personalised
        rate, their rate may have changed so significantly from the representative
        APR that a different term is more appropriate to give them a monthly payment
        closest to their desired amount. \r\n\r\nThis can happen in both directions
        - someone might be an A*, and have a much lower APR (e.g. 3.5% vs 7.9% Rep
        APR), meaning they might be able to have a shorter loan term to hit their
        monthly; or they might be an E, and have a much higher APR (e.g. 25% vs 7.9%
        Rep APR), meaning they might have to have a longer loan to hit their monthly
        payment.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of monthly loan terms, and with different APRs
        for different people, we have to infer the best loan term to get as close
        as possible.\r\n\r\n## What\r\nImplement logic to identify the appropriate
        loan term to get as close as possible to the user''s desired monthly payment,
        taking into account personalised pricing.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\n1) Send a quote
        request to Broker API for balloon amount over fixed term as per rep example
        (and fake-decline it to enable request of second quote)\r\n\r\n2) Compare
        APR from the quote to full ratecard for corresponding LTV from the [http://swagger-ui.zopian.ad.zopa.com/?url=http://pricing.uat.ldn.zopa.com/swagger.json#!/default/get_feed,
        Pricing Service] to identify market of the user (example http://pricing.uat.ldn.zopa.com/feed?channel_type=broker&channel_code=RPCarRefiMedium&is_safeguarded=false)\r\n\r\n3)
        Find APRs for this market and the balloon amount across all terms \r\n\r\n4)
        Calculate the monthly repayments for each term for this balloon payment and
        market\r\n\r\n5) Compare these 5 monthly repayments to the desired monthly
        payment\r\n\r\n6) Pick the term with the lowest absolute discrepancy to the
        desired monthly payment\r\n\r\n7) Request another quote on Broker API with
        this term and balloon amount, using the corresponding LTV ratecard, and present
        this to the user accordingly\r\n\r\n## Acceptance\r\n\r\nScenario 1: Happy
        Path\r\n\r\nScenario 2: Identified loan term leads to a decline\r\n\r\nScenario
        3: Broker API times out\r\n\r\nhttp://youtrack.zopian.ad.zopa.com/issue/PBF-99"}]'

        Why\r\nThe customer promise with the balloon payment loans product is that
        we will get as close as possible to the monthly payment the customer would
        like with the offer we give them. \r\n\r\nOnce a customer gets a personalised
        rate, their rate may have changed so significantly from the representative
        APR that a different term is more appropriate to give them a monthly payment
        closest to their desired amount. \r\n\r\nThis can happen in both directions
        - someone might be an A*, and have a much lower APR (e.g. 3.5% vs 7.9% Rep
        APR), meaning they might be able to have a shorter loan term to hit their
        monthly; or they might be an E, and have a much higher APR (e.g. 25% vs 7.9%
        Rep APR), meaning they might have to have a longer loan to hit their monthly
        payment.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of monthly loan terms, and with different APRs
        for different people, we have to infer the best loan term to get as close
        as possible.\r\n\r\n## What\r\nImplement logic to identify the appropriate
        loan term to get as close as possible to the user''s desired monthly payment,
        taking into account personalised pricing.\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\n1) Send a quote
        request to Broker API for balloon amount over fixed term as per rep example
        (and fake-decline it to enable request of second quote)\r\n\r\n2) Compare
        APR from the quote to full ratecard for corresponding LTV from the [http://swagger-ui.zopian.ad.zopa.com/?url=http://pricing.uat.ldn.zopa.com/swagger.json#!/default/get_feed,
        Pricing Service] to identify market of the user (example http://pricing.uat.ldn.zopa.com/feed?channel_type=broker&channel_code=RPCarRefiMedium&is_safeguarded=false)\r\n\r\n3)
        Find APRs for this market and the balloon amount across all terms \r\n\r\n4)
        Calculate the monthly repayments for each term for this balloon payment and
        market\r\n\r\n5) Compare these 5 monthly repayments to the desired monthly
        payment\r\n\r\n6) Pick the term with the lowest absolute discrepancy to the
        desired monthly payment\r\n\r\n7) Request another quote on Broker API with
        this term and balloon amount, using the corresponding LTV ratecard, and present
        this to the user accordingly\r\n\r\n## Acceptance\r\n\r\nScenario 1: Happy
        Path\r\n\r\nScenario 2: Identified loan term leads to a decline\r\n\r\nScenario
        3: Broker API times out\r\n\r\nhttp://youtrack.zopian.ad.zopa.com/issue/PBF-99"}]'
